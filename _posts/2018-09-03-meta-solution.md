## <a name="intro"></a> [Introduction](#toc)
In my personal experience with problem solving I have found that time and time
again, there is no real "philosophy" of problem solving.[^fn1] And with that
lack of literature, I have been tasked with defining my own philosophy of sorts
for understanding, and thinking about problem solving.

To that purpose, I have frequently found my self thinking most determinedly on
a singular question: *Is there such a process that will ensure, know matter
what is known or unknown to you, the acquisition of the solution to the problem
you are faced with?* The short answer is yes: **structure**. The long answer
is where we shall focus our explication.
