## <a name="intro"></a> [Introduction](#toc)
One of the pros/cons of the *Ubiquiti UniFi*[^fn1] ecosystem is the necessity of the *UniFi controller* software.[^fn2] While this software ultimately works
well, it does require downloading and installing.[^fn2] This can be a bit undesirable to your veteran developer/engineer/hacker that does not want more applications cluttering their file system.

Luckily there is a **dockerized**[^fn3] version of the application that we will be discussing here, as well as the traditional install method, and a strategy for deploying the **docker container**[^fn4] to a **Raspberry Pi**[^fn5] server.
